# GitHub Copilot Metrics API Migration - Executive Summary

## 📋 Overview

This document provides a high-level summary of the proposed migration from the legacy GitHub Copilot Metrics API to the new Copilot Usage Metrics API, in response to GitHub's announcement that the legacy API will shut down on **April 2, 2026**.

## ⚠️ The Problem

**GitHub is shutting down the legacy Copilot Metrics API on April 2, 2026.**

- **Current State**: Application uses synchronous REST API calls to fetch metrics in real-time
- **Impact**: Without migration, the application will stop working on April 2, 2026
- **Action Required**: Migrate to new asynchronous file-based API before shutdown date

## 🎯 The Solution

We propose a **hybrid architecture** that:

1. ✅ **Maintains backward compatibility** - existing deployments continue to work
2. ✅ **Enables historical data analysis** - optionally store data in PostgreSQL
3. ✅ **Supports gradual migration** - no breaking changes, opt-in approach
4. ✅ **Improves performance** - database queries faster than multiple API calls

### High-Level Architecture

```
Current Architecture (Stateless):
User → API Handler → GitHub API (real-time) → Response

Proposed Architecture (Hybrid):
User → API Handler → {
  Single Day: GitHub API (new async download)
  Date Range: Database Query (fast)
} → Response

Background Sync:
Daily Job → Download Files → Store in PostgreSQL
```

## 🔑 Key Highlights

### Major Changes Required

1. **Database Addition** (PostgreSQL)
   - Store daily metrics for historical analysis
   - Enables fast date range queries
   - Optional for single-day queries

2. **API Integration Update**
   - Replace synchronous calls with async file downloads
   - Implement NDJSON parsing
   - Handle signed URL expiration

3. **Data Sync Service**
   - Background job to download daily metrics
   - Gap detection and retry logic
   - Admin controls for manual sync

4. **Backward Compatibility**
   - No breaking changes for existing deployments
   - Feature flags for gradual rollout
   - Works without database (limited functionality)

### Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Phase 1 | Weeks 1-2 | Database infrastructure |
| Phase 2 | Weeks 3-4 | New API integration |
| Phase 3 | Weeks 5-6 | Data sync service |
| Phase 4 | Weeks 7-8 | API layer updates |
| Phase 5 | Weeks 9-10 | Background scheduler |
| Phase 6 | Weeks 11-12 | Testing & docs |
| Buffer | Weeks 13-14 | Final testing |

**Total Time**: 12-14 weeks (3-3.5 months)

**Deadline**: Before April 2, 2026

## 💰 Cost Considerations

### Infrastructure Additions

1. **PostgreSQL Database**
   - Development: Free (docker-compose)
   - Production: $50-200/month (managed service)
   - Alternative: Self-hosted on existing infrastructure

2. **Storage Requirements**
   - Estimated: 100MB - 1GB per year (depending on organization size)
   - Negligible cost with modern cloud providers

3. **Development Time**
   - Estimated: 12-14 weeks (see roadmap)
   - Can be parallelized across team members

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Without Migration**:
- ❌ Application stops working April 2, 2026
- ❌ Loss of historical metrics data
- ❌ Emergency fix required (expensive, risky)

**With Migration**:
- ✅ Continued application functionality
- ✅ Better performance for date ranges
- ✅ Historical data retention beyond GitHub's 1-year limit
- ✅ More control over data

## 📊 Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Missing April 2 deadline** | High | Start immediately, 2-week buffer built in |
| **Database complexity** | Medium | Use managed service, comprehensive docs |
| **Team capacity** | Medium | Clear roadmap, can parallelize work |

### Risk Mitigation Strategy

1. **Start Early**: Begin implementation as soon as approved
2. **Incremental Approach**: Phase-by-phase delivery
3. **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage at each phase
5. **Contingency**: 2-week buffer for unexpected issues

## ✅ Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Review Documentation**: Technical team reviews architecture and roadmap
2. **Approve Design**: Stakeholders approve overall approach
3. **Allocate Resources**: Assign team members to implementation
4. **Provision Infrastructure**: Set up PostgreSQL for development
