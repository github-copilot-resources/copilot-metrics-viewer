This application displays a set of charts with various metrics related to GitHub Copilot for your <i>GitHub Organization</i> or <i>Enterprise Account</i>. These visualizations are designed to provide clear representations of the data, making it easy to understand and analyze the impact and adoption of GitHub Copilot. This app utilizes the [GitHub Copilot Metrics API](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28).

## Charts

## Key Metrics
Here are the key metrics visualized in these charts:
1. **Acceptance Rate:** This metric represents the ratio of accepted lines to the total lines suggested by GitHub Copilot. This rate is an indicator of the relevance and usefulness of Copilot's suggestions.

</p>

2. **Total Suggestions** This chart illustrates the total number of code suggestions made by GitHub Copilot. It offers a view of the tool's activity and its engagement with users over time.

3. **Total Acceptances:** This visualization focuses on the total number of suggestions accepted by users.

## Languages Breakdown Analysis

Pie charts with the top 5 languages by accepted prompts and acceptance rate are displayed at the top.

1. **Cumulative Number of Turns:** This metric represents the total number of turns (interactions) with the Copilot over the past 28 days. A 'turn' includes both user inputs and Copilot's responses.

2. **Cumulative Number of Acceptances:** This metric shows the total number of lines of code suggested by Copilot that have been accepted by users over the past 28 days.

3. **Total Turns | Total Acceptances Count:** This is a chart that displays the total number of turns and acceptances

4. **Total Active Copilot Chat Users:** a bar chart that illustrates the total number of users who have actively interacted with Copilot over the past 28 days.

1. **Total Assigned:** This metric represents the total number of Copilot seats assigned within current organization/enterprise.

2. **Assigned But Never Used:** This metric shows seats that were assigned but never used within the current organization/enterprise. The assigned timestamp is also displayed in the chart.

3. **No Activity in the Last 7 days:** never used seats or seats used, but with no activity in the past 7 days.

4. **No Activity in the last 7 days (including never used seats):** a table to display seats that have had no activity in the past 7 days, ordered by the date of last activity. Seats that were used earlier are displayed at the top.


## Setup instructions

In the `.env` file, you can configure several environment variables that control the behavior of the application.

#### VUE_APP_SCOPE 

The `VUE_APP_SCOPE` environment variable in the `.env` file determines the scope of the API calls made by the application. It can be set to either 'enterprise' or 'organization'.

- If set to 'enterprise', the application will target API calls to the GitHub Enterprise account defined in the `VUE_APP_GITHUB_ENT` variable.
- If set to 'organization', the application will target API calls to the GitHub Organization account defined in the `VUE_APP_GITHUB_ORG` variable.

For example, if you want to target the API calls to an organization, you would set `VUE_APP_SCOPE=organization` in the `.env` file.

````
VUE_APP_SCOPE=organization

VUE_APP_GITHUB_ORG= <YOUR-ORGANIZATION>

VUE_APP_GITHUB_ENT=
````
#### VUE_APP_GITHUB_TEAM

The `VUE_APP_GITHUB_TEAM` environment variable filters metrics for a specific GitHub team within an Enterprise or Organization account.
‼️ Important ‼️ When this variable is set, all displayed metrics will pertain exclusively to the specified team. To view metrics for the entire Organization or Enterprise, remove this environment variable.

````
VUE_APP_GITHUB_TEAM=

````

#### VUE_APP_MOCKED_DATA

To access Copilot metrics from the last 28 days via the API and display actual data, set the following boolean environment variable to `false`:

```
  VUE_APP_MOCKED_DATA=false
```

#### VUE_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN
Specifies the GitHub Personal Access Token utilized for API requests. Generate this token with the following scopes: _copilot_, _manage_billing:copilot_, _manage_billing:enterprise_, _read:enterprise_, _read:org_.

```
  VUE_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN=
```

## Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and runs the application
```
npm run serve
```

### Docker build
```
docker build -t copilot-metrics-viewer .
```

### Docker run
```
docker run -p 8080:80 --env-file ./.env copilot-metrics-viewer
```
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8080

## Running with API Proxy

Project can run with an API proxy which hides GitHub tokens and is secure enough to be deployed.
Api Proxy project is in `\api` directory. Vue app makes the calls to `/api/github` which then are proxied to `https://api.github.com` with appropriate bearer token.

Proxy can authenticate user using GitHub App. In order to do that, following environment variables are required:

* `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` - client Id of the GitHub App registered and installed in the enterprise/org with permissions listed above.
* `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` - client secret of the GitHub App
* `SESSION_SECRET` - random string for securing session state

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5596067-da9c-409d-9b9f-0a688cc1f2c4

It's also possible to run with **PAT Token**, see examples below for required variables.

For local development register `http://localhost:3000/callback` as GH App callback Uri.
For deployed version use the Uri of your app.

To build and run the app with API proxy:

```bash
docker build -t copilot-metrics-viewer-with-proxy -f api.Dockerfile .
```

To run:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:3000 --env-file ./.env copilot-metrics-viewer-with-proxy
```

Proxy can also run with token hardcoded on the backend (which hides it from frontend calls), here's a sample:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 \
-e VUE_APP_SCOPE=enterprise \
-e VUE_APP_GITHUB_API=/api/github  \
-e VUE_APP_GITHUB_ENT=<enterprise name> \
-e VUE_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN=<github PAT> \
-e SESSION_SECRET=<random string>  \
copilot-metrics-viewer-with-proxy
```

or

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 \
-e VUE_APP_SCOPE=organization \
-e VUE_APP_GITHUB_API=/api/github  \
-e VUE_APP_GITHUB_ORG=<org name> \
-e VUE_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN=<github PAT> \
-e SESSION_SECRET=<random string>   \
copilot-metrics-viewer-with-proxy
```
